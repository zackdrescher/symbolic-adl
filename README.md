# Symbolic ADL

Symbolic ADL is a combination of the [action description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_description_language) and Lewis Carrol's [Symbolic Logic](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28696/28696-h/28696-h.htm). At this point, Symbolic Logic is a research libary. However, potential applications include Planning and Scheduling and Procedural Narative Generation.
